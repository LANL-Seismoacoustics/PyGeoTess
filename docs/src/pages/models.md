Models can be loaded from file, or constructed from scratch (a grid file is still required).

## Load from file


```python
from geotess import Model

model = Model.read('geotess/data/crust20.geotess')
print(model)
```

```

Model Description: 
The Crust 2.0 model of Bassin, Laske and Masters (2000).

Bassin, C., Laske, G. and Masters, G., 
The Current Limits of Resolution for Surface Wave 
Tomography in North America, EOS Trans AGU, 81, F897, 2000.

http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/crust2.html

The original model was defined on a regular latitude-longitude
grid with 2 degree by 2 degree spacing.  It was cell-based,
meaning that the model attributes (p velocity, s velocity and
density) were attached to the cells, not the nodes at the 
corners of the cells.

This representation uses a triangular tessellation with 
1 degree edge lengths and it is node based, meaning that
the attributes are attached to the nodes at the corners
of the triangles, not the triangles.  The translation
was accomplished by first defining a node at the center 
of each 2 degree cell in the original model and then
interpolating attribute values at the nodes of the 
new model using simple bi-linear interpolation.  There
was certainly some interpolation error involved in this 
process.

In this representation, the water layer has been omitted.
The top of the new model is the surface of the solid 
Earth.  While the thickness of the water layer in the 
oceans can be deduced in the new model by assuming that
the surface of the oceans corresponds to depth zero, the
thickness of the water layer in large inland lakes and
seas has been lost.

In the new representation, layer boundaries are defined in 
terms of radius, not depth.  Depths in the original model
were converted to radius using the radius of the WGS84
ellipsoid.

Each `Model` has a `.grid`, which provides access to that Model's Grid instance.

Just like with `Grids`, PyGeoTess is distribed with the same GeoTess model files, like Crust2.0, which can be directly imported.


```python
from geotess.data import crust20

print(crust20)
```

```

## Create a Model from scratch

Creating a GeoTessModel from scratch requires a grid file, some layers, and some attributes.  PyGeoTess describes layers with 2-tuples.  The first entry is the layer name, the second is the correspoding tessellation id.  Similarly, with names and units, for attributes.  Convenience [`namedtuple`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) are provided, for readability.


```python
# look at the grid, so you can assign layers to tessellation ids.
from geotess.data import grid_16000
from geotess import Model, Layer, Attribute

print(grid_16000)
```

Now, let's save it.


```python
# binary version
model.write('myawesome.geotess')

# ascii version
model.write('myawesome.ascii')
```

## Roadmap

Make PyGeoTess work with both the standard CPython interpretor, using the GeoTess
c++ library and Cython, and the [Jython](http://jython.org) Python interpeter,
using the GeoTess Java library.
