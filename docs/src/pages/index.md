# PyGeoTess

GeoTess for Python programmers.

PyGeoTess is a Python interface module to the
[GeoTess](http://www.sandia.gov/geotess) gridding and earth model library from
Sandia National Laboratories.  It provides simplified access to a subset of the
GeoTess library, and takes advantage of of Python's interactive interpreter and
inline documentation system.
