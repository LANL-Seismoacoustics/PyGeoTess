# PyGeoTess

GeoTess for Python programmers.

PyGeoTess is a Python interface module to the
[GeoTess](http://www.sandia.gov/geotess) gridding and earth model library from
Sandia National Laboratories.  It provides two interfaces to a subset of the
GeoTess library: a direct interface to the GeoTess c++ classes and methods,
and a more Pythonic interface.
